## How to run server
- Install Deno (https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation/)
- (Deno is identical to NodeJS, there is no learning curve or code difference.)
- Change directory to ./server -> "cd ./server"
- Start server -> "deno task dev"

## How to run client
- (Assuming you have NodeJS set up already.)
- Change directory to ./client -> "cd ./client"
- Start server -> "npm run dev"
